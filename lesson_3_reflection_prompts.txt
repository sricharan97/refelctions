When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when you are working in a team rather than individually

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because automatically syncing remote repository would result in unecessary changes which get committed and visible publicly

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   forks : cloning one's repository in the github servers without cloning it to your local machine

  clones: Getting the copy of repository from another local machine or Github

  branches: this pertains to a single repository  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

   we can always check to compare whether there are any changes introduced in the remote branch through Github 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

   I just can't imagine collaborating without git and github. Manually sending the files over email for review is so inefficient and time consuming 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
