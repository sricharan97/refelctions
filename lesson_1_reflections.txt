How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   diff gives comparision of each line that was modified from older version to the newer version which makes it easy to focus only on the changes which possibly could have introduced the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You always have a chance to reflect on your approach to solving problems as you develop them incrementally. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros
     -> You don't end up saving unnecessary versions without any major logical change
    cons
     -> it is user dependent


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   Git is built as coding friendly VCS where many files can be interrelated.
   whereas Google docs expect it files as standalone files 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   git log will show the list of recent commits
   git diff is used to see the difference between two commits using ther commit ids 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

   Because we can always go back, we will be confident to experiment with the code. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use Git for all my Android projects
